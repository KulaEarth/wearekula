To do this, we will use art, storytelling, and conversation. Art transcends all, brings people together, and allows powerful stories to be told and heard. It also allows for the free flow of information and ideas that will help empower our civic space to continuously reimagine our future and then regeneratively recreate it through shared narratives. As a lateral organization, Kula will rely on art and storytelling to mobilize and engage at the grassroots level, and then finally through collective regenerative design and applied learning, weave and empower our communities to connect globally and act locally.\n\nKula is ever-evolving, but at its core, is all about building connected community-action networks. We recognize that there is already a lot of regenerative sustainable development work happening around the world, but a lot of it remains siloed. We want to help to connect individuals and resources (including knowledge) to publicly build local community-action-networks, or facilitate connections with existing ones!\n\nWe envision a world where sustainability, equity, and resilience are the norm. Our work is rooted in the idea that regenerative design can help us achieve this vision. Through regenerative design, we can create systems and structures that nurture and sustain the health of our planet, and that ensure the well-being of all its inhabitants.\n\nWe believe that collaboration and collective action are essential to creating lasting change. We seek to build relationships with stakeholders across disciplines and industries, to foster a sense of collective responsibility for the future of our planet, and to educate ourselves and others about regenerative design principles and best practices.\n\nWe seek to create systems that regenerate, rather than deplete, the natural environment, and that honour the needs of all living beings. We strive to bring balance, beauty, and purpose to our work and to the world. We are committed to creating a more sustainable, equitable and resilient future through regenerative design.\n\n![](/uploads/Screen-Shot-2022-10-31-at-10.02.16-1024x580.png)\n\n\n\n\n"
