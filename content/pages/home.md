      ### kula | कुल


      Kula, a Sanskrit word, translates to “community.” For us, Kula is this,
      and much more. It embodies the concept of deep belonging in the world and
      emphasizes being in the right relationship, not just with one another, but
      with all aspects of the environment (everyone and everything). Kula is
      about creating this sense of belonging within and between communities
      through art, storytelling, and conversations. Through regenerative design,
      we will weave globally and act locally in co-creating the initial
      conditions needed to allow harmonious and sustainable livelihoods to
      emerge.
